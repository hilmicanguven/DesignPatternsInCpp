SOLID Design Principles

  - Single Responsibility Principle:
        Your class or method should have only one reason to change.
        Your class or method should have only one responsibility to take care of.
  
  - Open-Closed Principle:
        Software entities (classes, modules, functions, and so on) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  
  - Liskov Substitution Principle:
        Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes.
  
  - Interface Segregation Principle:
        Do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.
  
  - Dependency Inversion Principle:
        High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
